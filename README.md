Caching with
Redis


Implement caching to optimize the
performance of your API.
-->Integrate Redis to cache the results of
   frequently accessed endpoints (e.g.,
   fetching all users).
-->Implement cache invalidation strategies
   when data changes (e.g., updating or
   deleting a user).
-->Set cache expiration for certain data to
   ensure it stays fresh.
-->Measure the performance improvements
   (e.g., response times before and after
   caching).
